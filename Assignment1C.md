### 1. Convolution

Convolution is a mathematical operation which is used in variety of fields like signal processing, image processing, etc. At its core convolution simply means multiplying two functions/signals/matrices to produce third function/signal/matrix. It can be represented as  __g(x,y) = h(x,y) * f(x,y)__ where __*__ is the convolution operator. In convolutional neural network we convolute the input matrix at any layer with the kernel to get the output matrix or the next layer. Below image will make it clear.
