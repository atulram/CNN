### 1. Convolution

Convolution is a mathematical operation which is used in variety of fields like signal processing, image processing, etc. At its core convolution simply means multiplying two functions/signals/matrices to produce third function/signal/matrix. It can be represented as  __g(x,y) = h(x,y) * f(x,y)__ where __*__ is the convolution operator. In convolutional neural network we convolute the input matrix at any layer with the kernel to get the output matrix or the next layer. Below image will make it clear.

### 2. Filters/Kernels

Filters/Kernels generally are the small sized matrices with which the input image is convolved to get a modified image. In image processing, kernels are used to sharpen, blur or perform similar tasks on the input image. In convolutional neural network, kernel/filter refers to the weight matrix which is convolved with the entire input image generating matrices which when activated gives the next layer. Gradually when the network learns, these kernels become capable of filtering features such as an edge or curve. Below example shows a edge detector kernel.
